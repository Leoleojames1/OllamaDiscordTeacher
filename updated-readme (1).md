## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Discord Bot Token ([Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications))
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/download) installed locally
- Recommended model: llama3.1:8b or faster/smaller models for better response time

### Installation
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ollama-teacher-bot.git
cd ollama-teacher-bot

# Set up environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure .env file
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_token_here
OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3.1:8b
TEMPERATURE=0.7
TIMEOUT=120.0
DATA_DIR=data
```

### Starting the Bot
```bash
# Linux/Mac
./startup.sh

# Windows
startup.bat
```

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Using Memory for Complex Topics
```
@Ollama Teacher !arxiv --memory 1706.03762 Explain attention mechanism
@Ollama Teacher !arxiv --memory 1810.04805 How does BERT build on this?
```

For long-term hosting on your local PC:

### Automatic Startup

#### Windows
1. Place `startup.bat` in your startup folder: `shell:startup`
2. Or create a scheduled task to run at login:
   ```
   schtasks /create /tn "Start Ollama Teacher Bot" /tr "path\to\startup.bat" /sc onlogon
   ```

#### Linux
1. Make the startup script executable: `chmod +x startup.sh`
2. Add to your startup applications or create a systemd service

## üîê Security & Privacy

- All data stored locally
- User-specific conversation isolation
- Admin-only global controls
- No external API dependencies except Ollama
- Regular automated cleanup

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Configuration

### Environment Variables
| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `OLLAMA_MODEL` | Model selection | llama3.1:8b |
| `TEMPERATURE` | Response creativity | 0.7 |
| `TIMEOUT` | Response timeout | 120.0 |
| `DATA_DIR` | Storage location | data |

### Memory Settings
- `MAX_CONVERSATION_LOG_SIZE`: 50 messages
- `MAX_TEXT_ATTACHMENT_SIZE`: 20,000 chars
- `MAX_FILE_SIZE`: 2MB
- `SYSTEM_PROMPT`: The base instructions that define the bot's personality and capabilities

## üîç Troubleshooting

- **Bot not responding**: Make sure Ollama is running (`ollama serve`)
- **Slow responses**: Use a smaller model or increase timeout
- **High memory usage**: Reduce `MAX_CONVERSATION_LOG_SIZE` in the code
- **Storage issues**: Check disk space if you've stored many papers/searches
- **Model loading issues**: Ensure you've pulled the model with `ollama pull model_name`
- **Command not working**: Make sure you're mentioning the bot before every command
