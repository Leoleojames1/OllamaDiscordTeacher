  <h3>Bringing AI-powered learning to your Discord server</h3>
</div>

A powerful Discord bot that helps your community learn about AI, Machine Learning, and programming concepts using Ollama's LLM capabilities. The bot features multiple learning modes, including research paper analysis, web searches, documentation crawling, and data analysis, all while storing information locally for quick retrieval later.

## About Ollama Teacher

Ollama Teacher is designed to make advanced AI learning accessible through Discord. Using Ollama's powerful LLMs locally, the bot serves as a dedicated learning assistant that can explain complex topics, analyze papers, search for information, and even understand documentation on the fly.

### How It Works

The bot leverages Ollama's local language models to provide AI-powered responses without sending user data to external services. It maintains conversation context, allowing for natural discussions about technical topics, and can intelligently parse different types of content:

- **ArXiv Papers**: Automatically extracts and summarizes academic papers
- **Web Content**: Crawls websites and documentation pages to understand and explain their content
- **Search Results**: Enhances DuckDuckGo search results with AI explanations
- **Stored Data**: Uses natural language to query previously encountered information

Each interaction is stored locally using efficient Parquet files, creating a growing knowledge base that can be queried later, making the bot smarter and more helpful over time.

OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3.1:8b
TEMPERATURE=0.7
TIMEOUT=120.0

# Storage Configuration
DATA_DIR=data
```

### Step 4: Start the bot
```bash
# Linux/Mac
./startup.sh

# Windows
startup.bat
```

## ü§ñ Bot Commands

All commands require mentioning the bot: `@Ollama Teacher command`

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `!help` | Display help information | `@Ollama Teacher !help` |
| `!reset` | Reset the conversation context | `@Ollama Teacher !reset` |
| `!arxiv <id> <question>` | Learn from an ArXiv paper | `@Ollama Teacher !arxiv 1706.03762 What is self-attention?` |
| `!ddg <query> <question>` | Search with DuckDuckGo | `@Ollama Teacher !ddg "ollama api" How do I use it?` |
| `!crawl <url> <question>` | Crawl a webpage & learn | `@Ollama Teacher !crawl https://pypi.org/project/ollama/ How do I use the ollama python package?` |
| `!pandas <query>` | Query stored data | `@Ollama Teacher !pandas Show me a summary of my searches` |
| `!learn` | Get default resources | `@Ollama Teacher !learn` |

## Example Use Cases

### Learning Complex Concepts
Ask the bot to explain difficult AI/ML concepts with code examples:
```
@Ollama Teacher What's the difference between CNN and RNN architectures?
```

### Researching Academic Papers
Let the bot summarize and explain research papers from ArXiv:
```
@Ollama Teacher !arxiv 1706.03762 Explain the key innovation in the paper
```

### Understanding Documentation
Have the bot crawl and explain documentation pages:
```
@Ollama Teacher !crawl https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html What is a Sequential module?
```

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running in Production

For long-term hosting on your local PC:

### Automatic Startup

#### Windows
1. Place `startup.bat` in your startup folder: `shell:startup`
2. Or create a scheduled task to run at login:
   ```
   schtasks /create /tn "Start Ollama Teacher Bot" /tr "path\to\startup.bat" /sc onlogon
   ```

#### Linux
1. Make the startup script executable: `chmod +x startup.sh`
2. Add to your startup applications or create a systemd service

### Performance Considerations

- Choose the appropriate Ollama model size for your hardware
- Adjust `MAX_CONVERSATION_LOG_SIZE` for memory usage
- Monitor disk space usage in the data directory

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

You can modify the bot's behavior by editing these variables in the `.env` file:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `OLLAMA_MODEL` | llama3.1:8b | Ollama model to use |
| `TEMPERATURE` | 0.7 | Response creativity (0.0-1.0) |
| `TIMEOUT` | 120.0 | Max seconds to wait for responses |
| `DATA_DIR` | data | Directory for storing data |

## Advanced Configuration

For more advanced customization, you can modify these parameters in `bot.py`:

- `MAX_CONVERSATION_LOG_SIZE`: Controls how much conversation history is kept (affects memory usage)
- `MAX_TEXT_ATTACHMENT_SIZE`: Maximum size for text file attachments
- `MAX_FILE_SIZE`: Maximum size for any file attachment
- `SYSTEM_PROMPT`: The base instructions that define the bot's personality and capabilities

## üîç Troubleshooting

- **Bot not responding**: Make sure Ollama is running (`ollama serve`)
- **Slow responses**: Use a smaller model or increase timeout
- **High memory usage**: Reduce `MAX_CONVERSATION_LOG_SIZE` in the code
- **Storage issues**: Check disk space if you've stored many papers/searches
- **Model loading issues**: Ensure you've pulled the model with `ollama pull model_name`
- **Command not working**: Make sure you're mentioning the bot before every command
